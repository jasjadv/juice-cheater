OWASP Juice Shop (Cheat Module) - Why you shouldn't use the Juice Shop for CTF-events rewarding prizes.

OWASP Juice Shop is a very nice way to train security/hacking skills. However when using the shop in CTF-events be aware of the fact it is fairly simple to abuse the continue-code of the shop to fake any progress without figuring out a challenge at all. 

This fairly simple python program will show you how to abuse this feature of the juice-shop. 

NOTE: Please only use this program on an instane of the OWASP Juice Shop you control yourself or has been setup for you alone. So don't be a jerk and use this on public instances of the OWASP Juice Shop.
